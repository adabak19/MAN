# Project Formulation and Initial Requirements

## Introduction
The **Online Library Management System** is a platform that allows users to search for, borrow, and review books, while providing library staff with tools to manage inventory and monitor book loans. As modern libraries embrace digital transformation, this system aims to deliver a seamless experience for both library members and administrators. 

We chose this project because it combines key elements of user management, data handling, and UI/UX design into a cohesive and practical application. Additionally, it holds real-world applicability, making it an attractive project for potential future use. Libraries today are evolving, and with more digital services being offered, a system like this can significantly enhance how users interact with both physical and digital books.
