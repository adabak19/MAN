Our Online Library Management System project has successfully implemented a robust and scalable platform that allows users to search for, borrow, and review books, while providing library staff with tools to manage inventory and monitor book loans. The system supports user authentication and role management, ensuring secure access to resources based on user roles. The project has achieved its primary goals, providing a seamless experience for both library members and administrators.
