# Project Update: Implementing Book Management Features
## Introduction
In this update, we are excited to share the progress we’ve made on the Online Library Management System project. We’ve implemented the foundation for managing books within the system by creating the Book Model, the Book Service, and the Book Controller. This setup enables us to perform the basic CRUD operations—essential for handling book data. Below, we’ll outline the changes we’ve made and how they contribute to the system’s functionality.
## Book Model: Defining the Book Structure
We began by defining the Book Model, which represents the structure of a book in our system. The model contains key properties like:
- Id: A unique identifier for each book.
- ISBN: The book's International Standard Book Number.
- Title: The name of the book.
- Author: The author of the book.
- YearPublished: The year the book was published.<br/><br/>
This model allows us to define a clear structure for each book, making it easy to manage and store book information within the system.
## Book Controller: Enabling HTTP Methods
To make the system accessible, we created the Book Controller, which defines the HTTP endpoints that allow users to interact with the system. We implemented the following HTTP requests:
- GET: Retrieve all books or a specific book by ID.
- POST: Add a new book to the system.
- PUT: Update an existing book’s information.
- DELETE: Remove a book from the system.<br/><br/>
These HTTP requests make it easy to interact with our system through simple API calls, ensuring that users can view, add, update, or remove books as needed.
## Conclusion
With these features in place, our system is now capable of handling the core functionality for managing books. Users can interact with the library's book collection, whether they want to browse available titles or update the details of existing books. This setup lays the groundwork for adding more advanced features, such as user management and book reviews, in the near future.

Stay tuned for our next update, where we will continue to expand on this foundation and add more exciting functionality to the Online Library Management System!
